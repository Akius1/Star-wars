                  <pre>It is a period of civil war.
                    Rebel spaceships, striking
                    from a hidden base, have won
                    their first victory against
                    the evil Galactic Empire.
                    <br>
                    During the battle, Rebel
                    spies managed to steal secret
                    plans to the Empire's
                    ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                    STAR, an armored space
                    station with enough power
                    to destroy an entire planet.
                    <br>
                    Pursued by the Empire's
                    sinister agents, Princess
                    Leia races home aboard her
                    starship, custodian of the
                    stolen plans that can save her
                    people and restore
                    freedom to the galaxy....</pre>
